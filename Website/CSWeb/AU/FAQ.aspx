        <li class="Q">What is Bellaplex<sup>&reg;</sup>?</li>
        <li class="A"> Bellaplex<sup>&reg;</sup> is a superior facial cream which contains four of the most effective substances 
          needed for real results. Bellaplex<sup>&reg;</sup> is unlike other skin creams. Most products use one or 
          maybe two of these important ingredients necessary for results. Bellaplex uses all four: 
          Matrxyl 3000<sup>&reg;</sup> + Hydrolyzed Collagen + Argireline<sup>&reg;</sup> + Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
          
          <a name="2"></a>
        <li class="Q">What do each of the primary ingredients in Bellaplex<sup>&reg;</sup> do?</li>
        <li class="A">Matrixyl™ 3000 promotes collagen production in the skin. Clinically proven, Matrixyl™ 3000, the key ingredient in Bellaplex, has been shown to:<br />
          • Decrease the look of deep wrinkles by up to 44%<br />
          • Visibly improve skin complexion and tone<br />
          • Improve skin smoothness<br />
          <br />
          Argireline<sup>&reg;</sup> is a combination of amino acids that helps to reduce the appearance of surface wrinkles.<br />
          <br />
          Hyaluronic Acid is virtually unmatched in hydrating the skin because of its ability to retain water more effectively than other natural substances. Supplementation of HA provides increased smoothness &amp; softening to combat facial wrinkles.        </li>
          
          <a name="3"></a>
        <li class="Q">How do I use Bellaplex<sup>&reg;</sup>?</li>
        <li class="A">Simply apply Bellaplex<sup>&reg;</sup> every day to the desired areas on your face to diminish and prevent the look of fine lines and wrinkles. For best results, Bellaplex<sup>&reg;</sup> should be used both in the morning and at night before going to bed.</li>
        
        <a name="4"></a>
        <li class="Q">How many ounces are in a one month bottle?</li>
        <li class="A">Each bottle contains one-ounce and lasts about 1 month.</li>
        
        <a name="5"></a>
