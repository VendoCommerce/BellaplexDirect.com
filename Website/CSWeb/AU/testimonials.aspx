     <p>&quot;I am 41 and have been noticing fine lines around <br />
       my eyes and deeper lines on my forehead and in <br />
       my smile lines. I have tried 2 other product lines <br />
       with some improvements. I read the reviews and <br />
       decided to try the Bellaplex trial offer. I am pleased <br />
       with this product. My skin texture is now very <br />
       smooth, the look of lines have started to ease. <br />
       The product goes a long way. I am still wearing <br />
       makeup to cover, but I am hopeful that I may <br />
       finally be able to give up constant makeup <br />
       touch ups! Thank you!&quot; <br />

     <p>&quot;I became interested in Bellaplex when I saw the <br />
       ingredients it contained, specifically peptides - <br />
       Matrixyl 3000&trade;. I am 46 years old and have noticeable <br />
       wrinkles beginning to set in. I received my first order <br />
       of Bellaplex and have used your product 2 times a <br />
       day since then. I have noticed a definite improvement <br />
       in the look of fine lines around my lips, and some <br />
       improvement in the look of deeper facial expression <br />
       lines. I plan on continuing to use Bellaplex to see <br />
       it's full effects with the continued use. So far I am <br />
       happy with the results and hope to see even more.&quot; <br />

     <p>&quot;At the age of 67, I wanted more than just a temporary cover-up; I wanted noticeable results. I have been applying the Bellaplex lotion daily over the past few weeks, and yes, I am noticing results. The progress is enough to make me a believer that indeed I can look younger than my years. I thank you researchers, for giving me hope and seeing the results.&quot; <br />

     <p>&quot;I have been looking for a moisturizer that actually worked. I Googled ratings for moisturizers and a website popped up that had rave reviews for Bellaplex. I decided to try Bellaplex and have been very happy with the results. I have noticed my skin is smoother and healthier looking. I have even had people ask me if I have had &quot;work&quot; done! I really like the consistency of the product. It feels very smooth going on and it is not greasy. It absorbs quickly so it doesn't interfere with applying my makeup. I also really like the auto-ship. I never have to worry about running out or having make a trip to the mall. I have been recommending Bellaplex to all my friends. Thank you.&quot; <br />

     <p>&quot;I was searching for a skin care product that contained &quot;all the right stuff&quot; which would address the needs of my skin as I entered my 50's. Keeping my skin as youthful as possible is important to me both personally as well as professionally. Having worked for a plastic surgeon and dermatologist I have seen the results of high priced medical office skin care lines. After 3 months of using BELLAPLEX I am delighted to be receiving compliments on my skin and baffling those who think I am in my late 30's! Hydrated skin and minimized the appearance of wrinkles around my eyes and lips have made me a confirmed user of BELLAPLEX! I would recommend BELLAPLEX to anyone who is interested in an affordable product that produces amazing results!!!!&quot; <br />

     <p>&quot;I had been searching product comparisons for this type of product online because I am in my late thirties and I notice &quot;crows feet&quot; around my eyes and fine lines above my lips. Bellaplex had ALL of the clinically proven ingredients I was searching for as opposed to the other products and was rated high. I have used Bellaplex on only one side of my face. Today, I asked both of my children, separately, to guess which side I used Bellaplex wrinkle cream on. Both of them guessed correctly. I asked why they chose the side they did. They said because the wrinkles were less noticeable around my eyes and mouth. There is definitely a noticeable difference and in such a short period of time. I am excited to continue use of this product on both sides of my face now! I also went with the continuity of this product and was able to speak with customer service and change the date of my next shipment with ease. This product is a must for me from this point on.&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Scarlett C.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;WOW!&quot; I am so surprised by the incredible effects Bellaplex has brought to my life. I not only look younger, but my skin feels softer and looks brighter. I no longer have to worry about acne or looking greasy because this light cream goes on smooth and lasts all day without adding too much moisture. I can feel the wonderful effects of Bellaplex as soon as I put it on my face. I have used other creams for years but Bellaplex does in 2 months what these other creams couldn't do in over 5 years! Thank you Bellaplex for saving my face and my check book.&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Mark G.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;I have used your product, BELLAPLEX, for 2 months now and it is by far the best product I have ever used for skin care. Being 70 years of age, believe me, I have tried most everything!! So easy and neat to use, never rubs off nor leaves a greasy effect or residue on clothing. Just use it once at night and once in the morning before applying makeup and that is all that's needed for a clean fresh look and feeling. Love the pump bottle for an exact amount without any waste - will certainly use BELLAPLEX FROM NOW ON.&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Sally C.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;I have been using Bellaplex for about three weeks, and love it. It has a very smooth feeling on my face, doesn't feel sticky at all. I do not have huge wrinkles under my eyes, but enough that I want to start fighting them. I started to notice an improvement within 2 weeks; can't wait to see what results I will have in 2 more weeks.&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Danielle T.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;I am 46 years old and was beginning to see signs of aging in my face. Worried about wrinkles and skin care I stumbled onto a website that described Bellaplex and had great reviews. I began using Bellaplex about 6 months ago. Last week during a conversation a coworker assumed I was in my mid 30's and was astonished to find that I was 46 years old. He exclaimed &quot;but you don't have any lines on your face&quot;. Thanks Bellaplex.&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Jane P.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;This is a great product. I'm on my second order of Bellaplex and I definitely see an overall improvement in my skin. I am 52 years old and people have been complimenting me lately on my skin and saying that I look younger. I also notice that lines on my face are less noticeable. I have tried many products but this one is certainly the best one I have ever used. My skin feels firmer and looks more radiant. The cream is not greasy and is absorbed immediately leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth. I love this product....&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Frances V.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;I have tried this product for 2 months. I have definitely noticed that my skin texture is softer and smoother. It soaks right in and is not greasy or heavy. I have noticed slight fading in the look of sun spots. I just turned 40 and don't want to look any older. I think this is helping.&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Jennifer S.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;I started using Bellaplex two months ago because I am in my mid 40's and wanted something to help with the fine wrinkles around my eyes. I noticed a difference within the first week and now my cheeks are definitely smoother. It is not greasy and soaks in fast which I like because I have moderately oily skin. I also noticed a difference in the look of the depth of wrinkles in my &quot;smile lines.&quot; I haven't really noticed much difference under my eyes but I will continue to use it as it is definitely working.&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Michelle V.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;I stumbled across an article on the internet that highly recommended Bellaplex. While I have used many anti-aging products, both high and low-end, I did not see any changes in my skin as suggested by the manufacturer. I have been using Bellaplex for approximately 45 days and have seen some improvement around my eyes and also my skin appears much smoother and softer. I look forward to seeing even more improvement as I continue to use the product. Thank you!&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Jill B.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;I really researched this product, including reviews from websites which evaluate and recommend the best products on the market. I was sold by the ingredients in Bellaplex, which makes it a superior product available today. I've used Bellaplex for a month and have had remarkable results. I am really excited because the look of fine lines around my mouth and eyes are diminishing and the over all tone of my skin has improved. So soft and younger feeling already. A college friend visited recently and commented on how great my skin looked without me even fishing! Can't wait to see my skin after 6 months!&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Lee K.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;I Love Bellaplex. I have been using this product for 7 weeks now and I have to say it is the best wrinkle cream I have ever used. I have tried so many creams ranging from drug store brands to high end lines and this one beats them all. There is a remarkable difference in the look of the &quot;eleven&quot; between my eyes and the fine lines around my mouth. I have dry, sensitive skin and now it is more hydrated, softer, plumper and no problem with irritation. I am on the monthly auto-ship program and will be a Bellaplex person forever!!!&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Marsha E.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;I have been using Bellaplex for over a month now and am already seeing results! At 45, I have always been teased about the frown lines between my eyes and was beginning to become more concerned about them as well as some horizontal lines on my forehead. I have noticed that the look of my frown lines are softening significantly as well as my forehead lines! Last week my husband lovingly looked at me and said &quot;How do you do it - we have been married nearly 21 years and you look more beautiful now than you did when we first got married&quot;! I took that as the ultimate compliment. And, a couple of days later, I was &quot;carded&quot; when I purchased some wine and was more than excited about that! All's I could think was &quot;Wow, this Bellaplex stuff really works! Thank you for a product that truly delivers - I especially love my 24 hr. &quot;baby soft&quot; face! I will be using it for the rest of my life!!&quot; <br />
       <strong>- Linda C.</strong></p>
     <p>&quot;I started using Bellaplex five weeks ago, and my skin feels softer and looks better. The lines around my eyes also look softer and less noticeable. It works as a great base for the little make-up that I use. I wanted to keep the little lines from getting bigger and new lines from starting. I read about Bellaplex on line while looking for healthier make up. I am very pleased with Bellaplex.&quot; <br />
